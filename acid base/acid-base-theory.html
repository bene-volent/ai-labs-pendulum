<h1>Acid-Base pH Indicators</h1>

<p>pH indicators are special chemicals that change color depending on how acidic or basic a solution is. They're like chemical "traffic lights" that help us understand what's happening in a solution without expensive equipment.</p>

<h2>What is pH?</h2>

<p>The <strong>pH scale</strong> measures how acidic or basic (alkaline) a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>pH 0-6:</strong> Acidic (sour, like lemon juice)</li>
    <li><strong>pH 7:</strong> Neutral (like pure water)</li>
    <li><strong>pH 8-14:</strong> Basic or Alkaline (bitter, like soap)</li>
</ul>

<p>The "pH" stands for "potential of Hydrogen" because it measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution. More hydrogen ions mean more acidic, fewer hydrogen ions mean more basic.</p>

<h2>How Do Indicators Work?</h2>

<p>pH indicators are weak acids or bases that exist in two different forms - one colored form in acidic solutions and another colored form in basic solutions. When you add an indicator to a solution, it "chooses" which form to be based on the pH, causing the color change you see.</p>

<h3>The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation</h3>

<p>Scientists use this equation to predict indicator behavior:</p>

<div class="formula">
    pH = pKₐ + log([base]/[acid])
</div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>pKₐ</strong> = The pH where the indicator is exactly half in acid form and half in base form</li>
    <li><strong>[base]</strong> = Amount of indicator in base form</li>
    <li><strong>[acid]</strong> = Amount of indicator in acid form</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Indicators in This Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Litmus Paper (Simple Indicator)</h3>

<p><strong>Litmus</strong> is one of the oldest and simplest pH indicators. It has a pKₐ of about 7.0, which means:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Below pH 7:</strong> Red color (acidic form dominates)</li>
    <li><strong>At pH 7:</strong> Purple color (mixture of red and blue)</li>
    <li><strong>Above pH 7:</strong> Blue color (basic form dominates)</li>
</ul>

<p>Litmus is great for quick tests - "Is this acidic or basic?" - but it doesn't tell you the exact pH.</p>

<div class="experiment-hint">
    <p><strong>Try This:</strong> Switch to Litmus indicator and slide the pH from 0 to 14. Notice how it changes from red to blue around pH 7. The transition is smooth because the indicator molecules are gradually switching forms.</p>
</div>

<h3>2. Universal Indicator (Full Range)</h3>

<p><strong>Universal indicator</strong> is actually a mixture of several different indicators, each with a different pKₐ. This creates a beautiful rainbow of colors across the entire pH range:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>pH 1-2:</strong> Red (very acidic)</li>
    <li><strong>pH 3-4:</strong> Orange (acidic)</li>
    <li><strong>pH 5-6:</strong> Yellow (weakly acidic)</li>
    <li><strong>pH 7:</strong> Green (neutral)</li>
    <li><strong>pH 8-9:</strong> Blue (weakly basic)</li>
    <li><strong>pH 10-11:</strong> Indigo (basic)</li>
    <li><strong>pH 12-14:</strong> Purple/Violet (very basic)</li>
</ul>

<p>Universal indicator is much more useful for finding the approximate pH of a solution because each color represents a different pH range.</p>

<div class="experiment-hint">
    <p><strong>Try This:</strong> With Universal indicator selected, test all the common solution presets. See how battery acid is deep red, pure water is green, and drain cleaner is purple!</p>
</div>

<h2>Path Length - Why Does It Matter?</h2>

<p>The <strong>path length</strong> is how far light travels through the solution. Imagine looking through a test tube from the side (short path) versus from the top through the liquid (long path).</p>

<p><strong>Longer path length = Darker, more intense color</strong></p>

<p>This follows the <strong>Beer-Lambert Law</strong>, which states that color intensity increases with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Longer path through the solution</li>
    <li>Higher concentration of indicator molecules</li>
</ul>

<div class="formula">
    A = ε × c × l
</div>

<p>Where A = Absorbance (color intensity), ε = molar absorptivity, c = concentration, l = path length</p>

<div class="experiment-hint">
    <p><strong>Try This:</strong> Set pH to 10 (basic) and change the path length from 0.5 cm to 2.0 cm. Watch the blue color get deeper and more vivid!</p>
</div>

<h2>Common Solutions and Their pH</h2>

<h3>Strong Acids (pH 0-3)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Battery Acid (pH 1):</strong> Sulfuric acid used in car batteries - extremely corrosive</li>
    <li><strong>Lemon Juice (pH 2):</strong> Contains citric acid, gives lemons their sour taste</li>
    <li><strong>Vinegar (pH 2.4):</strong> Acetic acid used in cooking and cleaning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weak Acids (pH 4-6)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Orange Juice (pH 3.5):</strong> Contains vitamin C (ascorbic acid)</li>
    <li><strong>Coffee (pH 5):</strong> Contains various organic acids</li>
    <li><strong>Milk (pH 6.5):</strong> Slightly acidic due to lactic acid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Neutral (pH 7)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pure Water (pH 7):</strong> Perfect balance of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weak Bases (pH 8-10)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sea Water (pH 8):</strong> Slightly basic due to dissolved minerals</li>
    <li><strong>Baking Soda (pH 9):</strong> Sodium bicarbonate used in baking</li>
    <li><strong>Milk of Magnesia (pH 10.5):</strong> Antacid used to neutralize stomach acid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strong Bases (pH 11-14)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ammonia (pH 11.5):</strong> Cleaning solution, very irritating</li>
    <li><strong>Bleach (pH 12.5):</strong> Sodium hypochlorite used for disinfection</li>
    <li><strong>Drain Cleaner (pH 14):</strong> Sodium hydroxide - extremely caustic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Is pH Important?</h2>

<h3>1. In Our Bodies</h3>
<p>Human blood must stay at pH 7.35-7.45. Even small changes can be dangerous! Our bodies work hard to maintain this balance through chemical buffers.</p>

<h3>2. In Nature</h3>
<p>Ocean acidification (pH dropping from 8.2 to 8.1) is threatening coral reefs and marine life. Acid rain (pH < 5) damages forests and buildings.</p>

<h3>3. In Daily Life</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Soap (pH 9-10) removes oils and dirt</li>
    <li>Shampoo (pH 5-6) matches hair's natural pH</li>
    <li>Swimming pools (pH 7.2-7.8) for comfort and safety</li>
    <li>Soil pH affects which plants can grow</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Science Behind the Colors</h2>

<p>When indicator molecules encounter H⁺ ions (acids) or OH⁻ ions (bases), they undergo a chemical change that alters their structure. This structural change affects which wavelengths of light they absorb and reflect, causing the color change you see.</p>

<p>For example, in litmus:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Acidic form:</strong> Has extra H⁺ attached, absorbs blue-green light → appears RED</li>
    <li><strong>Basic form:</strong> Has lost H⁺, absorbs red-yellow light → appears BLUE</li>
</ul>

<h2>Machine Learning and pH Prediction</h2>

<p>This experiment offers two ways to predict indicator colors:</p>

<h3>Chemistry Formula Method</h3>
<p>Uses the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and RGB color interpolation to calculate colors mathematically. This is how chemists have understood indicators for over a century.</p>

<h3>Machine Learning Method</h3>
<p>A neural network learns to predict RGB colors by studying 1000 examples of pH-color relationships. It discovers the patterns without knowing the chemistry equations! This shows how AI can learn scientific relationships from data alone.</p>

<div class="experiment-hint">
    <p><strong>Compare Both Methods:</strong> Train the ML model, then switch between Formula and ML modes with different pH values. Notice how well the machine learning model mimics the chemistry - it learned the Henderson-Hasselbalch behavior without being told the equation!</p>
</div>

<h2>Try These Experiments</h2>

<div class="experiment-hint">
    <p><strong>Experiment 1:</strong> Mixing Acids and Bases<br>
    Start with vinegar (pH 2.4). Imagine adding baking soda (pH 9.0). What color would you see at pH 5? At pH 7? This is neutralization!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Experiment 2:</strong> Indicator Comparison<br>
    Set pH to 7.0. Compare Litmus (should be purple) vs Universal (should be green). Which gives you more information?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Experiment 3:</strong> Path Length Effect<br>
    Set pH to 3 (orange juice). Change path length from 0.5 to 2.0. Notice how the orange gets darker? This is why test tubes show colors better than flat dishes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Experiment 4:</strong> Train the AI<br>
    Switch to ML Mode and train the model. Then test it with random pH values. Can the AI predict colors as accurately as the chemistry formula?</p>
