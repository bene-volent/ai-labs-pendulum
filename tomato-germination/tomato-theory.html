<h1>Tomato Plant Growth & Phenology</h1>

<p>
    Growing plants is one of nature's most fascinating processes. From a tiny seed emerges a complex organism that 
    responds to its environment, accumulates energy from sunlight, and produces fruits—all following predictable 
    biological patterns. This experiment lets you explore how temperature, water, light, and nutrients affect a 
    tomato plant's 90-day journey from seed to harvest.
</p>

<h2>What is Plant Phenology?</h2>

<p>
    <strong>Phenology</strong> is the study of periodic life cycle events in plants and animals. For tomato plants, 
    these stages include germination, seedling growth, vegetative development, flowering, fruit set, and ripening. 
    Each stage happens in a specific sequence and is triggered by environmental cues—especially temperature.
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>The Seven Stages of Tomato Growth:</strong><br>
    <code>Seed → Germination → Seedling → Vegetative → Flowering → Fruit Set → Fruit Development → Ripening</code>
</div>

<h2>Growing Degree Days (GDD): The Temperature Clock</h2>

<p>
    Unlike animals with internal body heat, plants are <strong>ectothermic</strong>—their metabolic rate depends on 
    external temperature. Scientists use <strong>Growing Degree Days (GDD)</strong> to measure the accumulated heat 
    energy a plant receives over time.
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>Daily GDD Formula:</strong><br>
    <code>GDD<sub>daily</sub> = max(0, T<sub>avg</sub> - T<sub>base</sub>)</code><br><br>
    Where:<br>
    • <code>T<sub>avg</sub></code> = Average daily temperature (°C)<br>
    • <code>T<sub>base</sub></code> = 10°C (tomato's minimum growth temperature)<br>
    • GDD is measured in degree-days (°C·d)
</div>

<h3>How GDD Works</h3>

<p>
    Think of GDD as a "thermal timer" for plant development. Each day above 10°C, the plant accumulates degree-days. 
    When the cumulative GDD reaches certain thresholds, the plant transitions to the next growth stage:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>0-50 GDD:</strong> Germination (seed absorbs water, embryo activates)</li>
    <li><strong>50-200 GDD:</strong> Seedling (cotyledons emerge, first true leaves appear)</li>
    <li><strong>200-400 GDD:</strong> Vegetative growth (rapid stem elongation, leaf production)</li>
    <li><strong>400-700 GDD:</strong> Flowering (yellow flowers bloom at leaf nodes)</li>
    <li><strong>700-1000 GDD:</strong> Fruit set (pollinated flowers develop into green tomatoes)</li>
    <li><strong>1000-1300 GDD:</strong> Fruit development (tomatoes enlarge)</li>
    <li><strong>1300+ GDD:</strong> Ripening (green tomatoes turn red as chlorophyll breaks down)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
    <strong>💡 Example:</strong> At a constant 24°C, the plant accumulates 14 GDD per day (24 - 10 = 14). 
    It would reach the flowering stage (400 GDD) in approximately 29 days.
</div>

<h2>Environmental Factors Beyond Temperature</h2>

<p>
    While GDD drives stage transitions, four other factors modulate <em>how fast</em> the plant grows within each stage:
</p>

<h3>1. Soil Moisture (💧)</h3>
<p>
    Water is essential for photosynthesis, nutrient transport, and cell turgor. Too little causes wilting; too much 
    causes root rot and oxygen deprivation.
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>Moisture Multiplier:</strong><br>
    • Optimal: ~60% (multiplier = 1.5)<br>
    • Too dry (10%): multiplier = 0.5<br>
    • Too wet (100%): multiplier = 0.5<br>
    Effect: <em>Parabolic curve peaking at 60%</em>
</div>

<h3>2. Sunlight Hours (☀️)</h3>
<p>
    Tomatoes are sun-loving plants requiring 8-12 hours of light daily for optimal photosynthesis. More light = more 
    glucose production = faster growth (up to a saturation point).
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>Light Multiplier:</strong><br>
    • 0 hours: multiplier = 0.4 (survival mode)<br>
    • 12+ hours: multiplier = 1.4 (maximum photosynthesis)<br>
    Effect: <em>Linear increase up to 12 hours, then plateaus</em>
</div>

<h3>3. Soil Nutrients (🌾)</h3>
<p>
    Plants require nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), plus micronutrients like calcium and iron. 
    Our model uses a simplified "nutrient index" (0-100) representing overall soil fertility.
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>Nutrient Multiplier:</strong><br>
    • Low (0): multiplier = 0.6 (stunted, yellowing leaves)<br>
    • High (100): multiplier = 1.4 (lush, dark green foliage)<br>
    Effect: <em>Linear relationship</em>
</div>

<h3>4. Pest Pressure (🐛)</h3>
<p>
    Insects, diseases, and herbivores reduce plant health by damaging leaves, stems, and fruits. High pest pressure 
    slows growth and can destroy developing tomatoes.
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>Pest Multiplier:</strong><br>
    • No pests (0): multiplier = 1.0<br>
    • Severe (10): multiplier = 0.7 (30% growth reduction)<br>
    Effect: <em>Linear negative impact, plus direct fruit loss in late stages</em>
</div>

<h2>The Growth Equation: Biomass Accumulation</h2>

<p>
    The plant's internal "biomass" (total living tissue) grows according to a <strong>logistic equation</strong>—
    fast initially, then slowing as the plant approaches its maximum size:
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>Daily Biomass Change:</strong><br>
    <code>ΔB = r × B × (1 - B) × GDD<sub>effective</sub></code><br><br>
    Where:<br>
    • <code>r</code> = Growth rate constant (0.05)<br>
    • <code>B</code> = Current biomass (0 to 1, representing 0% to 100% mature size)<br>
    • <code>(1 - B)</code> = Remaining growth potential<br>
    • <code>GDD<sub>effective</sub> = GDD<sub>daily</sub> × moisture × light × nutrients × (1 - pest)</code>
</div>

<p>
    Biomass is then converted to observable traits:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Height:</strong> <code>150 × (1 - e<sup>-4B</sup>)</code> cm (max 150 cm)</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Count:</strong> <code>40 × (1 - e<sup>-3B</sup>)</code> leaves (max 40)</li>
    <li><strong>Fruit Count:</strong> Generated during "fruit_set" stage, reduced by pests later</li>
</ul>

<h2>Germination: A Special Case</h2>

<p>
    Before growth can begin, the seed must <strong>germinate</strong>—a process requiring specific conditions:
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>Germination Rate:</strong><br>
    <code>Rate = 15% × T<sub>factor</sub> × M<sub>factor</sub></code><br><br>
    • <code>T<sub>factor</sub></code> = 1.0 at 22°C (optimal), decreases with distance from ideal<br>
    • <code>M<sub>factor</sub></code> = 1.0 at 55% moisture (optimal)<br>
    Seed is "germinated" when accumulated percentage reaches 100%
</div>

<div class="warning">
    <strong>⚠️ Cold Shock:</strong> Below 10°C, tomato seeds won't germinate. At 8°C, the seed remains dormant 
    indefinitely, waiting for warmer conditions.
</div>

<h2>Health Index: Overall Plant Condition</h2>

<p>
    The plant's health is a weighted average of environmental conditions, reflecting leaf color, disease resistance, 
    and vigor:
</p>

<div class="formula">
    <strong>Health Index (0-1):</strong><br>
    <code>Health = 0.55 × moisture + 0.20 × light + 0.25 × nutrients - 0.03 × pests</code>
</div>

<p>
    A health index above 0.8 indicates thriving conditions (dark green leaves, rapid growth). Below 0.5 signals stress 
    (yellowing, stunted growth).
</p>

<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

<h3>1. Precision Agriculture</h3>
<p>
    Farmers use GDD models to predict harvest dates, schedule irrigation, and apply fertilizers at optimal times. 
    Knowing when flowering will occur allows targeted pest control and pollinator management.
</p>

<h3>2. Climate Change Impact Studies</h3>
<p>
    As global temperatures rise, GDD accumulation rates change. This model helps predict how warming affects crop 
    yields—will tomatoes ripen earlier? Will pests have more generations per season?
</p>

<h3>3. Greenhouse Management</h3>
<p>
    In controlled environments, growers can manipulate temperature, light cycles, and nutrients to accelerate or 
    delay growth stages, maximizing yields and timing harvests for market demand.
</p>

<h3>4. Educational Simulations</h3>
<p>
    Students can experiment with "what-if" scenarios impossible in real life: What happens if temperature drops 
    to 5°C for a week? How does zero sunlight affect fruit production? Can extreme nutrients compensate for 
    low moisture?
</p>

<h2>Formula vs. Machine Learning</h2>

<p>
    This experiment offers two prediction modes:
</p>

<h3>Formula Mode (Physics-Based)</h3>
<p>
    Uses the mathematical equations described above—deterministic, explainable, and based on biological principles. 
    Perfect for understanding <em>why</em> plants behave as they do.
</p>

<h3>ML Mode (Data-Driven)</h3>
<p>
    A neural network trained on 1000+ simulated growth cycles learns patterns without being explicitly programmed 
    with formulas. It can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Predict height at any target day (e.g., "How tall on day 60?")</li>
    <li>Handle complex non-linear interactions between factors</li>
    <li>Improve with more training data (including your experimental runs)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
    <strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> The ML model doesn't "understand" GDD or photosynthesis—it recognizes 
    statistical correlations in the data. Yet it can achieve high accuracy (RMSE &lt; 3 cm) by learning the 
    underlying patterns encoded in the physics-based simulation.
</div>
